# Project Idea:
Gathering data from the top five major grocery chains in the United States and Canada, focusing on reviews for Fresh and Frozen Salmon Fillets and Portions. The objective is to compile customer feedback for each store in various cities, categorizing each review based on specific aspects. For instance, if a review highlights an issue with packaging, it will be classified under "Faulty Packaging."
